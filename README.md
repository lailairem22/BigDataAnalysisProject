Big Data Analysis Project Stages:
  
  1. Selecting Data
  2. Define Research Goals 
  3. Preprocessing Data
  4. Literature Review 
  5. Model Fitting on Data
  6. Model Perfomance Comparison

The github repository contains:
  1. **Data:** contains in 'thyroid_cancer_risk_data.csv'
  2. **Research goals:** contains in 'Project_abstract.pdf'
  3. **Preprocessing:** Python codes for preprocessing is contained in 'Project_Thyroid_Cancer_Preprocessing.py'
  4. **Literature review:** contained in 'Project_literature_review.pdf'. This file also contains the preliminary results.
  5. **Model Fitting on Data:** 'Big Data Analytics Project - Initial Results.ipynb' file contains all analyses performed for this project.
  6. **Model Performance Comparison** along with all analyses results are contained 'Big Data Analytics Project - Initial Results.pdf' file
