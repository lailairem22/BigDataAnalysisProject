Big Data Analysis Project Stages:
	1. Selecting Data
  2. Define Research Goals 
	3. Preprocessing Data
  4. Literature Review 
	5. Model Fitting on Data
  6. Model Perfomance Comparison

The github repository contains:
  1. Data: contains in 'thyroid_cancer_risk_data.csv'
  2. Research goals: contains in 'Project_abstract.pdf'
  3. Preprocessing: Python codes for preprocessing is contained in 'Project_Thyroid_Cancer_Preprocessing.py'
  4. Literature review: contained in 'Project_literature_review.pdf'. This file also contains the preliminary results
  5. Model Fitting on Data: 'ProjectDataAnalysis.ipynb' file contains all analysis performed for this project.
  6. Model Performance Comparison along with all analysis results are contained 'ProjectDataAnalysis.pdf' file
